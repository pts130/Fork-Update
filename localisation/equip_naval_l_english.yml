 submarine_1_desc:0 "Submarines are stealthy vessels designed to take out undefended convoys. The early models from the Great War pave the way for new methods of naval warfare."
 submarine_2_desc:0 "Better armed and more stable, new submarine designs are made to take advantage of advancements in naval tactics and have longer range, being able to attack distant convoy routes."
 submarine_3_desc:0 "The role of the submarine in the fleet outside of convoy attacks is still under debate. Achieving a balance between combination of speed, range and weaponry will be key to the necessary model."
 submarine_4_desc:0 "Increased test depth and efficient layouts will be features of the modern submarines, taking advantage of field experience to select appropriate armaments and engines."

 destroyer_2_desc:0 "Longer torpedo range and faster reload speeds, along with new types of armaments such as anti-air turrets, will allow our destroyers to remain efficient and versatile."
 destroyer_3_desc:0 "To better face threats from above and below, new destroyers must be outfitted with radar and modern anti-air and anti-submarine weaponry."

 carrier_2_desc:0 "Despite new efforts at treaties, refitting lighter cruisers with heavier weaponry remains efficient, although armor is still limited."
 carrier_3_desc:0 "As restrictions are increasingly ignored worldwide, more balanced heavy cruiser designs with more priority on armor can be built. Better anti-air guns allow these ships to cooperate in naval air warfare."

 battleship_1_desc:0 "Considered by some to be a relic of a bygone era of naval warfare, by others as the most impressive ships ever built, no one can deny that these remnants of the battleship arms race constitute some of the most heavily armed and armored vessels ever built."
 battleship_2_desc:0 "With improved stability and range, a new generation of battleships improve upon previous designs while remaining within limits stipulated by naval treaties."
 battleship_3_desc:0 "Thicker armor, stronger engines, a battery of high-caliber guns and improved anti-air capabilities can allow battleships to remain relevant, if correctly employed, in a world where naval warfare is increasingly dominated by aerial support."
 battleship_4_desc:0 "As the world sees what may be the last major battleship confrontations, the importance of heavy armaments and anti-air turrets is greater than ever."

 carrier_1_desc:0 "Many military theorists believe that naval aviation is the future. Converting old capital ships and ocean liners to carry aircraft will be the first step towards utilizing these new doctrines."
 carrier_2_desc:0 "As work begins on the first keel-up carrier designs, we must ensure that these ships have the range and speed to keep up with the rest of our navy, while respecting the post-war naval treaties."
 carrier_3_desc:0 "Improved construction methods and more specialized systems like deck edge elevators allow these carriers to transport more planes more efficiently."
 carrier_4_desc:0 "With many naval treaties now increasingly ignored, we can proceed to build carriers capable of transporting more planes than ever to secure air superiority cover."
 SH_battleship_1:0 "Super-Heavy Battleship I"
 SH_battleship_2:0 "Super-Heavy Battleship II"
 SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The current state of the world no longer has any room for abiding by naval treaties. Without these limitations, we can focus entirely on creating the heaviest, most well-armed battleships of all time, able to engage multiple lesser vessels."
 SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "An improvement on our earlier super heavy design with stronger weapons and improved fire control systems."
